### In this work, we propose a fair POI allocation technique that balances user satisfaction and POI capacity-based exposure simultaneously. The proposed model uses existing personalised POI recommendation model that captures users to POI visits' spatio-temporal influences and user interests. After that, we propose POI capacity-based allocation using the over-demand cut policy and under-demand add policy. This allocation ensures POIs exposure ratio and envy-free up to certain thresholds. We evaluate our proposed model performance on five datasets containing real-life POI visits. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines in terms of user and POI-based evaluation metrics.
